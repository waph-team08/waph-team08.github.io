        <p> <b>Course Overview:</b>
        <i>This course delves into the intricacies of web application development and hacking, 
            equipping us with essential skills in both areas. 
            Through a blend of theory and hands-on practice, we explore the foundational elements of front-end development, 
            including HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end development using PHP and MySQL. 
            A key focus is understanding the architecture of web applications and the symbiotic relationship between client-side
            and server-side components. Moreover, we delve into the realm of web application security, where they uncover common 
            vulnerabilities and attacks through practical exercises. The course aims to empower us with the ability to develop secure and robust web 
            applications while arming them with the knowledge to identify, prevent, and mitigate potential security threats. By combining theoretical concepts with real-world examples, 
            students gain practical experience in designing and implementing web-based solutions that adhere to secure programming practices and principles. Overall,
            this course prepares us to navigate the complex landscape of web development and cybersecurity, enabling them to build resilient and secure web applications in accordance with industry standards.</i> </p>
